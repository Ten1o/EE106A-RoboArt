# oneStroke

Use *oneStroke drawing*, to draw a portrait. 

## Description

All the implementations are in `foo.py`. 

In `dev` branch, there is a `GLHF/` folder containing a jupyter notebook that will help you get a better feeling of this implementation. 

Unfortunately this implementation does not find a Euler path, even if the graph is somehow Eulerian graph. (by somehow I mean almost impossible, unless magic) 

## Dependencies

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Basically, it's just `opencv-python`, `numpy`, `scipy`. Not too many dependencies. Actually, `jupyter` and `matplotlib` is also required if you want to dive in `GLHF/` in the `dev` branch.

## Last But Not The Least
Good Luck Have Fun :)
